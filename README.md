This repository accompanies the paper "*Enhanced Efficiency Assessment in Manufacturing: Leveraging Machine Learning for Improved Performance Analysis*" by M.D. Guillen, V. Charles, and J. Aparicio.

This repository contains an adaptation of EATBoosting, a novel application of gradient tree boosting within the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) framework, designed to address the challenge of undesirable outputs. By leveraging machine learning, EATBoosting enhances the discriminatory power of traditional DEA models, improving efficiency estimations through the integration of advanced regression trees with shape constraints.

The new approach was tested using data from printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing, which is available upon request.
